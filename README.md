Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end social media application.

### Project Reflection

This project is my delivery as the final exam at Noroff. It was developed over a time span of 7 weeks, where we plan, design and code everything from scratch.

Code ToAd is a social media platform using the Noroff social API where you can create an account, create your own post, read other users posts, comment and react with emojis, see other profiles, get followers and follow other people. Customize your profile with a banner and a profile picture.

All the planning and the cycle of the project development went very well. I think I have established a good way of working that suits me well. I decided to learn a little bit about the API before deciding any layout and design ideas because I wanted to get more inspiration before I created the prototype. By combining these two activities I ended up with time to spare and not much wasted, I think this was a good decition.
The most challenging part of the development was to make everything update "automaticly" as requests to the server was made. By using useReducer and Context API I am able to update each state immidietly and it creates a very fast UI.
I have learned a lot and been introduced to new ways of developing and gained much more knowledge about how everything works together when using React. This project has also led me to be more efficient using the developer tools and debugging my code.
Overall the process has been fun and I am happy with the end result.
